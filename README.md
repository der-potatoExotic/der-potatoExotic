Some basic things:
- Trilingual person
- Randomly uses programs to code (Either Jetbrains Rider, CLion, VS2022, Vim, or VSCode)
- Questionable relation with Python
- Hates fancy and complicated C++ features (What even is SFINAE anyway?)

  
Languages that I have (painfully and (MAYBE) regretfully) experienced/used/looked:
- C# (Root)
- C/C++ (Main thing)
- Python (WHY)
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- PHP
- Java
- Assembly (God no.)
- Any shading language (GLSL, HLSL. Which I don't like.)
- Lua

Frameworks/Libraries/SDK/Game engine that I have also (painfully and (MAYBE) regretfully) experienced/used/looked:
- .NET
- MonoGame
- XNA Framework (Don't ask on how I managed to make it work on [VS2022 using Windows 11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/der-potatoExotic/der-potatoExotic/refs/heads/main/Screenshot%202025-04-18%20133231.png))
- Unity (...)
- DirectX (Please no.)
- Vulkan (I would rather DirectX 12.)
- BGFX
- SDL
- GLFW
- Qt
- A lot more. (Like ImGui, GLEW, FMOD, Etc.)

Please do not talk about my relation with Unity Technologies. [September 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)#Runtime_fee_controversy) does not forget their actions. ;)
